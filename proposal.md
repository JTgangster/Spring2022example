I dont want celebrities or influencers to dominate the platforms but to geuine connect with people who has the same interests as you. Also to have live news of the things that interests you in whether its a celebrity you like or politics and gets you nofiications of it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In order to build the social media platform, im using flask in python which would be the programming language for the web application. So I need to learn flask tools and features when creating the web applications. skills I need to acquire are HTML, sql, CSS and JavaScript. If im doing mobile app , I might be needing to learn android development or research phonegap. I also need to reaserach on front end/ client side, and back end / server side.
