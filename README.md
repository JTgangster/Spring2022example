# Spring2022
Final project for 1051
This is my first time building a website, let alone doing something this grande by myself so it was difficult to build my vision on what I wanted for this project. 


I have to download Sublime text which is a shareware cross-platform source code editor and had to learn the features of this app. 


Needed to know how to use Windows PowerShell to display my website and the commands like python manage.py runserver, python manage.py migrate,cd .\OneDrive\Documents\socialNetwork\socialnetwork\,pip install Django-allauth Django-crispy-forms, django-admin startproject, cd.\socialnetwork\, python manage.py startapp, python manage.py createsuperuser, 


Having an understanding of Django including class-based views and the Django templating syntax.
